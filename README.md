## Coding style (for recruiters)

To get a feel for my coding style, compare my "message received" event handler to the two main public templates: the community guide of discord.js's and Discordeno's.

- [Discord.js's community guide](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot/blob/master/events/messageCreate.js)
- [Discordeno's](https://github.com/discordeno/template/blob/main/src/events/message_create.ts)
